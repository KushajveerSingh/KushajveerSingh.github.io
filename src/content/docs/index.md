## About

Hi, I’m Kushaj, and I work as a Software Engineer for a living.

I’m passionate about _hiking_ and _backpacking_, often incorporating _orienteering_ into my adventures. I’ve embarked on various backpacking trips that have included fishing, rock climbing, bird watching, and mountain biking. On the water, _paddleboarding_ is my favorite way to explore, but I also enjoy the thrill of _white water rafting_.

I’m also working on a personal goal to visit all the state parks in Georgia, USA--14 down so far--and with the national parks next on my list. After that, I have an ambitious plan to climb the top 52 highest mountain peaks in the world, starting with Everest and working my way down in 52 weeks--a challenge I really want to take on to see the limits of my body.

I enjoy expressing my creativity through painting in various mediums. Over the years, I’ve worked with _acrylic_, _gouache_, _aqua oils_, _watercolor_, and _silk painting_, with _aqua oils_ being my personal favorite because, when I showed my mom a painting from each medium, she liked the one in aqua oils the most.

You can find me riding my bicycle across the city, running, playing basketball, or relaxing at home watching _Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition_ or playing Tetris.
