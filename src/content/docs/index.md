## About

Hi, I'm Kushaj--a Software Engineer by profession.

I’m passionate about _hiking_ and _backpacking_, often incorporating _orienteering_ into my adventures. I’ve embarked on various backpacking trips that have included fishing, rock climbing, bird watching, and mountain biking. On the water, _paddleboarding_ is my favorite way to explore, but I also enjoy the thrill of _white water rafting_.

I’m currently on a personal mission to visit all the state parks in Georgia, USA--14 down so far-- with the national parks next on my list. Following hat, I plan to climb the 52 highest mountain peaks in the world over 52 weeks, starting with Everest--a challenge I'm eager to undertake to test the limits of my body.

In addition to my outdoor pursuits, I enjoy expressing my creativity through painting in various media. Over the years, I’ve worked with _acrylic_, _gouache_, _aqua oils_, _watercolor_, and _silk painting_, with _aqua oils_ being my personal favorite. When I showed my mom a painting from each medium, she liked the one in aqua oils the most.

You can find me riding my bicycle across the city, running, playing basketball, or relaxing at home watching _Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition_ or playing Tetris.
