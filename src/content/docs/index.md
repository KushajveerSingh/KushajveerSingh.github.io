## About

Hi, I'm Kushaj--a Software Engineer by profession.

I’m passionate about _hiking_ and _backpacking_, often incorporating _orienteering_ into my adventures. I’ve embarked on various backpacking trips that have included fishing, rock climbing, bird watching, and mountain biking. On the water, _paddleboarding_ is my favorite way to explore, but I also enjoy the thrill of _white water rafting_. I’m currently on a personal mission to visit all the state parks in Georgia, USA--14 down so far-- with the national parks next on my list.

In addition to my outdoor pursuits, I enjoy expressing my creativity through painting in various media. Over the years, I’ve worked with _acrylics_, _gouache_, _aqua oils_, _watercolor_, and _silk painting_, with _aqua oils_ becoming my personal favorite--particularly after my mom admired one of my paintings created with them.

You can find me riding my bicycle across the city, running, playing basketball. At home, I enjoy playing Pool, watching _Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition_, or playing _Tetris_.
