## Prettier - Disable markdown formatting

Prettier plugin to disable formatting of content inside codeblocks in markdown. Need to handle the case of using more than 3 backticks to specify a codeblock.

Disable formatting of content inside frontmatter i.e. inside `---`.

Publish on `npm`, `jsr`. Look for other alternatives.

Look at top npm packages, and copy their repository structure.
