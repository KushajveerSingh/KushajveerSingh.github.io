## (Prettier) - Rewrite in C++

**Motivation**\
Unopinionated prettier alternative. In Markdown, prettier would currently format codeblocks and that would mess up JS code. And the way to avoid this is by adding prettier ignore comments, which is annoying.

**Goal**

-   It should be drop in replacement.
-   Rewrite in C++.
-   Clear all [prettier tests](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/tree/main/tests/format) to ensure success.
-   All the 3rd party plugins/integrations should work automatically. For this you might have to force people to rename your package to "prettier" manually (or through a script, soft alias).

Other stuff

-   Make every formatting option of prettier available as a config option.
-   Prettier plugin to disable formatting of content inside codeblocks in markdown. Need to handle the case of using more than 3 backticks to specify a codeblock.
-   Additionally, code inside codeblocks should be formatted as per the provided language.
-   Disable formatting of content inside frontmatter i.e. inside `---`.
-   Publish on `npm`, `jsr`. Look for other alternatives.
-   Copy prettier repository/doc/npm structure.
-   By default, the new formatter should behave the same as prettier.
-   Provide a config file, which includes all the config options, that people can read top-to-bottom. This is one thing that I found annoying with current tools, as you have to check the docs for all possible options and sometimes they are not even documented properly.
-   C++23 is the target and the formatting should be parallelized.
-   Look at prettier alternatives like [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) written in Rust and do speed comparisons.

## (Other) Project version and info tracker

**Motivation**\
Make it easier to track the dependency of packages used across multiple projects, thus helping with version upgrades. And the same reasoning for personal info, like the tagline I use across all social media.

Other stuff

-   For every dependency, For every dependency, show the location and version number that the dependency is used in, in tabular form. Current version, latest version, location. Set the background of the table cell based on how far the current version is from the latest version.
-   Create a C++ script that can automatically get the version number of all the dependencies used by a project. So if you have 10 projects, you provide it 10 urls/locations and 10 methods to get all the required version numbers. And then you run the script whenever you want to update the page. It also fetches the latest package version.
-   The information can be outputted in some standard format (read on which format to choose).
-   Also, add personal information tracking. Like you are using a tagline across multiple social media accounts and pages. So you list things like tagline, name and then list of all locations those things are used.
