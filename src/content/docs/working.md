Notes repo

-   Reread starlight.md for corrections and after prettier-plugin.
-   Add astro.config options.
-   Move the repo to .github.io. As this would make it easier to add projects and stuff like that in the future.
-   On homepage, create an option to "view projects".
-   The projects should have a showcase page and then documentation part.
-   Copy todo from .github.io
-   Add head tags after reading html docs to astro.config.mjs
-   Create a template for head tags for markdown frontmatter
