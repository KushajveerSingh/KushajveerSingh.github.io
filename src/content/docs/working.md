Notes repo

-   Reread starlight.md for corrections and after prettier-plugin.
-   Add astro.config options.
-   On homepage, create a dialog of what this website is about. These are the things that I currently know in depth (also link to the relevant projects for that). And then, here are the projects that I have worked. This should be about half a page summary of the projects, which then redirect to the main project showcase and detail page. And a separate link for the documentation, which would be maintained in this repo as well.
-   Copy todo from .github.io
-   Add head tags after reading html docs to astro.config.mjs
-   Create a template for head tags for markdown frontmatter

Move exploring-cpp-development to this repo

internal page - Create a version thing, where you can track what version of the software is the documentation for. This can be a separate page.

internal page - Create a separate page to track all the software being used in different projects, which can be used for easier updates later.
